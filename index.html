                     <p> Nostalgia is defined as "a sentimental longing or wistful affection for the past, typically for a period or place with happy personal associations."
                      It didn't really need to be defined since most people have a really good idea of what it is.  
                  </p>
                  <p>But the issue I have with Nostalgia is the selective nature of Nostalgia. Actor/Director Jodie Foster sent the internet into a frenzy with one simple quote, “Going to the movies has become like a theme park.” She added, “Studios making bad content in order to appeal to the masses and shareholders is like fracking — you get the best return right now but you wreck the earth.” Then in a final jab she said, “It’s ruining the viewing habits of the American population and then ultimately the rest of the world.” 
                  
              </p>
              <p>This quote sent the internet and superhero filmmakers into a frenzy. Was she right, are superhero movies ruining enverything abouut movies. Well no, but her quote paints
                  a somewhat nostalgic view of the past, where audience where not pandered to and movies were not attractions. This is an idea I want to dive into further. No seemed like a good place to just write down a strating point.
